## Our Mission & Vision

### MISSION

To PROVIDE and PROMOTE innovative, culturally and linguistically accessible wellness programs and services for the ZSFG community of staff, patients, their families, and all San Franciscans.

### VISION

A sustainable, vibrant, healthy, engaged, and compassionate community.

* Promote health and wellness through healthy lifestyle choices;
* Enhance patient care and patient safety through wellness ; and
* Create a safe, healthy work environment for all employees, patients and visitors.

### OVERVIEW

Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital’s (ZSFG) Community Wellness Program works to promote and encourage wellness practices for patients, staff, and all San Franciscans.  We support a holistic view of health in which physical, emotional, mental, social, and spiritual health are considered interconnected and essential in achieving improved health and wellness.  Wellness classes are designed to accommodate patients and staff at all levels of physical abilities and/or limitations.  Most of our wellness class instructors are bilingual (English/Spanish or English/Cantonese).

### VALUES

We encourage community building and provide opportunities for participants to promote wellness through developing an understanding and appreciation of their peers.  At ZSFG, we are fortunate to be able to promote wellness through building on the rich cultural/ethnic diversity of our patients and staff. We incorporate strategies that build upon the unique strengths and abilities participants already possess. We value and appreciate having fun as another vital component of wellness promotion. While the Community Wellness Program vigorously promotes interventions aimed at addressing lifestyle issues such as diet and smoking, we also recognize the ways in which social determinants of health such as housing status, neighborhood safety, and access to affordable healthy food play a critical role in wellness promotion. With this in mind, we work to incorporate strategies such as public health education and advocacy in addressing poor health outcomes.

### HOLISTIC APPROACH

The Community Wellness Program offers opportunities for participants to enhance health and well-being through healing movement classes, healthy cooking demonstrations, relaxation strategies, caregiver support, and much more.  Through our cadre of experienced wellness instructors, we offer a wide variety of fun and engaging classes.  Please see our calendar of events for a current schedule of wellness classes and other activities. All the programs and services we offer are open to all and free of charge.

### YEARLY REPORT
