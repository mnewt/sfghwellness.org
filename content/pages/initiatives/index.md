## Initiatives & Programs

The Community Wellness Program works to fulfill its mission by focusing on four core initiatives.

### Healing Moves, Active Living

#### Working on Wellness (WOW) Classes

The Working on Wellness (WOW) program consists of weekly movement and healing classes for staff, patients, their families, and all San Franciscans. Classes include Strength Training, Chair Stretch and Boogie, Zumba & Zumba gold (low-impact), Yoga (offered in English, Spanish , and Cantonese), Mindful Meditation, Hip-Hop, Salsa, Bollywood, Chair Massage, and Healthy Cooking Demos. Wellness classes are free and open to all.

#### Chair Massage

We offer free 10-minute chair massages every 1st and 3rd Thursday of every month. In the near future, we will be offering hospital providers and staff chair massages in their respective units!

### Healthy Food Environment

The Healthy Food Environment Initiative reaffirms our commitment to creating a healthy, sustainable, environmentally friendly food environment for the ZSFG Community.  Promoting healthy food and nutrition is fundamental to the effective treatment and care of ZSFG patients as well as the wellbeing of its staff and providers.

Garden Giveaways
Our Garden Giveaways program, student interns and volunteers work with hospital gardeners to harvest and distribute hospital-grown vegetables and herbs to participants in hospital-based chronic and acute disease management groups as well as participants in the hospital’s smoking cessation program. The vegetables and herbs are accompanied by relevant recipes in English and Spanish. The mission is to provide fresh organic produce to patients and their families in order to inspire an incorporation of vegetables into their daily diets. All produce that is shared with participants are grown locally in one of our many onsite ZSFG raised garden beds.

CSA (Community Supported Agriculture)
Affordable produce is here! The Community Wellness Program has teamed up with Imperfect Produce to provide affordable CSA options for our community!

Nutrition and Cooking Demonstration Program
We offer monthly classes in our Wellness Demonstration Kitchen (in the Community Wellness Center) where participants have an opportunity to learn about new foods and easy, fresh recipes. When in season, participants can also take home produce from the campus gardens through our Garden Giveaways program. The classes include simple tips for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Other topics discussed in the classes include hydration tips, label reading for hidden sugars and salt, cooking with spices, and preparing soups and stews. Learn More!

Lunch Food Truck Program
Food trucks are bringing their flavorful fare to ZSFG  Monday-Friday from 11:30am-2:30 pm! A different truck serves food in the 23rd St parking lot near Hearty Cafe. Take advantage of this tasty delight!

ZSFG Healthy Beverage Initiative
In alignment with ZSFG’s strategic plan to enhance wellness, the Healthy Beverage Initiative formalizes our commitment towards creating a healthy environment that promotes healthy lifestyles for patients, staff, visitors and the community at large. In June 2015, ZSFG launched this initiative to replace sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) with healthier options across the campus.

### Community Engagement
The Community Engagement Initiative addresses our commitment to working collaboratively with related community programs and organizations to promote, cross-refer, and help ensure that programs and services are available and accessible to all San Franciscans, particularly for those who face challenges related to language, literacy, and/or economic status.

#### Summer Fest at ZSFG

We host an annual seasonal festival at ZSFG, known as Summer Fest, which focused on seasonal, locally grown and natural foods and emphasizing the benefits of exercise and enjoying San Francisco’s great outdoors. We offer healing movement classes such as Belly Dancing, Hula, Soul-Line Dancing, and drumming, healthy cooking demonstrations, community booths with fun, interactive activities and health-related “giveaways” sponsored by health projects, parks, and other local programs. 

### Tobacco Free Community Initiative
The ZSFG Tobacco Free Community (TFC) Initiative was formed to promote and provide tobacco cessation services on campus and beyond with similar goals and mutual support to improve long term tobacco cessation. This allows for a more comprehensive approach to bridge, expand, and strengthen tobacco free initiatives at our hospital and into our community.  This initiative advances smoking cessation strategies for hospitalized inpatients by upgrading existing guidelines, protocols, and educational materials. Initiative is led through the following work groups and report up into the ZSFG Community Wellness Program as well as collaborates with the SFDPH Community Health Promotion and Prevention’s Tobacco Free Project Stop Smoking Program to provide community/outpatient tobacco cessation programs.

Inpatient Tobacco Treatment (ITT) Services (including Behavioral Health Center)
Community/Outpatient Tobacco Treatment Programs (led by the SFDPH Tobacco Free Project)
Tobacco Free Policies & Communication Committee
Community Wellness Programs and Services
Goals include identifying current smokers, ensuring inpatients receive nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), assessing readiness to quit, and providing education, counseling and appropriate outpatient smoking cessation program referral at discharge for those who are ready to quit.
