The C.A.R.E. Program is designed for people with cancer who receive their care and treatment at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. Through the C.A.R.E. Program, people diagnosed with cancer receive education and support, as well as a free, healthy, and delicious meal every week.

During each week of the 6-week series, group members learn about many wellness and cancer topics, participate in relaxation exercises, and share information with one another. A different health professional visits each week to share information and skills that can help patients take care of themselves. Each session is intended to be interactive, experiential, and practical.

A cancer diagnosis changes your life in powerful ways. Through the C.A.R.E. Program, we want to make sure that no one goes through that experience alone. We want to help you learn about ways to improve your health and well-being. We want to introduce you to people who have a lot of knowledge about cancer — health care professionals and other individuals with cancer. Each week, group facilitators and guest speakers will guide the group in discussion and activities. Participants and guest speakers will share ideas and strategies that can have positive effects on patients’ health.
