[Living Wellness](http://vimeo.com/80499461 "Living Wellness") from the [Community Wellness Program](http://vimeo.com/communitywellnessprogram "Community Wellness Program") on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/).

**A documentary profiling Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital patients and staff as they promote their own physical and emotional health and well-being**.

ZSFG’s Community Wellness Program teamed up with local independent documentary filmmaker Kelly Whalen, to highlight stories of patients, community members, and staff on their journeys to wellness.  The Community Wellness Program sought to celebrate some of our amazing community members who have already been focusing on wellness and prevention.  The film profiles members of the ZSFG community whose wellness experiences will inspire and motivate others.  The film illustrates ways in which people can overcome challenges and receive countless benefits through participating in wellness activities at the Community Wellness Center as well as in their respective neighborhoods and homes.
