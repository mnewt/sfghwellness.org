On Thursday, October 11th, 2012 providers and staff from the hospital and throughout the CHN began a forum to help maintain compassion  our work by taking care of ourselves. The Schwartz Center Rounds, now taking place at more than 250 healthcare facilities in 36 states, offers a regularly scheduled time during our fast-paced work lives to openly and honestly discuss social and emotional issues that arise in caring for patients. In contrast to traditional medical (grand) rounds, the focus is on the human dimension of medicine. Caregivers have an opportunity to share their experiences and feelings on thought-provoking topics drawn from actual patient cases. The premise is that caregivers are better able to make personal connections with patients and colleagues when they have greater insight into their own responses and feelings.

A hallmark of the program is interdisciplinary dialogue. Panelists from diverse disciplines participate in the Rounds, including physicians, nurses, social workers, psychologists, chaplains, medical interpreters, and others. After listening to a panel’s brief presentation on an identified case or topic, caregivers in the audience are invited to share their own perspectives on the case and broader related issues.

## Sample Topics include:

 * Non-adherent patients
 * Team conflict around treatment plans
 * Does stopping treatment mean giving up?
 * Pain management in the addicted patient
 * Cultural and religious barriers
 * Caring for patients who live in dire poverty
